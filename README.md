# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Our goal in this analysis is to determine the number of employees that are about to retire and which positions the hold. Predicting upcoming retirement numbers and calculating the number of employees ready eligible for mentorship will assist in determining hiring needs going forward.

## Results

We found that a high number of employees will likely retire in the near future. Below we can see the numbers broken down by job title.
- Staff 32,452
- Senior Engineer 29,415
- Engineer 14,221
- Senior Staff 8,047
- Leader 4,502
- Assistant Engineer 1,761

## Summary

We indeed have a "silver tsunami" coming with a total of 90,398 positions needing to be imminently filled. 1,940 employees are eligible for mentorship so even if each mentor takes 5 people under their wing, there will still be too few mentors. There is a big demand here for new and experienced hires. It may be worth considering a new training plan for new employees to get them up to speed as quick as possible to help offset the demand for mentors.
